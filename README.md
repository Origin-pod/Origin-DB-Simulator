# DB Simulator

> Because reading about databases is boring. Building them is fun.

## The Origin Story

You know that feeling when you're reading *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* or *Database Internals* and your eyes start glazing over at page 47?

Yeah, me too.

Books about B-trees, LSM trees, MVCC, and WAL are dense. The concepts are fascinating, but reading 800 pages of text about how databases work is... well, let's just say it's not the most exciting Saturday night.

Then I had a thought: **What if instead of just reading about databases, I could build one? And not just one - what if I could build dozens, trying different combinations, seeing the tradeoffs play out in real-time?**

What if learning database internals felt like playing with LEGO?

That's this project.

## What is this?

**DB Simulator** is a visual tool where you take database building blocks and compose them together to create your own database. Then you can run queries, watch how it executes, and see the tradeoffs in action.

Think:
- **Unreal Engine Blueprints**, but you're learning databases
- **Scratch programming**, but the output is a working storage engine
- **Figma**, but you're designing MVCC instead of UI

## Why This Exists

Reading about databases teaches you *what* things do.

Building databases teaches you *why* they do it that way.

Want to understand why Cassandra uses LSM trees instead of B-trees? Build both and run the same workload. Watch the LSM tree handle writes faster but reads slower. See the write amplification. Feel the tradeoff.

Want to grok the difference between 2PL and MVCC? Build both. Watch how 2PL blocks readers, but MVCC lets them run free. See why PostgreSQL chose MVCC.

**Learning by doing beats reading every time.**

## What's Inside

This project provides modular blocks across the entire database stack:

```
src/blocks/
├── storage/           # LSM trees, B-trees, Log-structured storage
├── index/             # Hash indexes, B+ trees, Learned indexes
├── concurrency/       # 2PL, MVCC, OCC, timestamp ordering
├── transaction-recovery/ # WAL, ARIES, shadow paging
├── query-execution/   # Volcano, vectorized, JIT compilation
├── optimization/      # Rule-based, cost-based, learned optimizers
├── buffer/            # LRU, Clock, 2Q policies
├── compression/       # Dictionary, RLE, Snappy, Zstd
├── partitioning/      # Range, hash, list partitioning
└── distribution/      # Replication, sharding, consensus
```

## The Vision

### Today (The Boring Timeline)
1. Have idea for new DB architecture: **Day 1**
2. Implement storage engine: **Week 2**
3. Add indexes and query layer: **Week 4**
4. Build test harness: **Week 6**
5. Realize design doesn't work: **Week 8**
6. Start over: **Week 9** 😭

### Tomorrow (The Fun Timeline)
1. Have idea: **9:00 AM**
2. Drag-drop blocks in visual editor: **9:15 AM**
3. Run simulated workload: **9:20 AM**
4. Compare 5 alternatives: **10:00 AM**
5. Ship validated design: **That afternoon** 🚀

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/DB-Simulator.git
cd DB-Simulator

# Explore the block system
ls src/blocks/

# Read the vision
cat docs/Modular\ DB\ Builder\ -\ PRD\ \(Shreyas\ Style\).md
```

## Who Is This For?

### You'll love this if you:
- Design databases or data systems
- Think about tradeoffs between consistency and performance at 2am
- Want to understand why Cassandra made the choices it did
- Need to evaluate 5 different approaches before building
- Teach database systems and want better visualizations
- Just think databases are neat

### You'll hate this if you:
- Think all databases should be MySQL
- Don't care about p99 latency
- Believe visual programming is a toy
- Already have all the answers

## Project Status

**Current Stage**: Early prototype / Design phase

We're building the foundation. Check the roadmap:
- `/docs/8-Week Roadmap - Modular DB Builder.md` - Implementation timeline
- `/docs/Design Document - Modular DB Builder.md` - Technical architecture
- `/docs/Wireframes - Modular DB Builder.md` - UI mockups

## The Grand Challenge

Can we make database experimentation as fast as having the idea?

If we succeed, teams will try 10 alternatives before building. Database research will accelerate. Fewer companies will cargo-cult PostgreSQL when they need something different.

And maybe, just maybe, someone will finally answer the question: "What if everything was a log?"

## Contributing

This is an early-stage project. If you're excited about:
- Visual programming for systems
- Database internals
- Making complex things approachable
- Building tools that make builders faster

...then you're in the right place. Check `/docs` for the full vision and roadmap.
